# Source

Notebooks and dataset comes from [https://github.com/kazunori279/TensorFlow-for-absolute-beginners/](https://github.com/kazunori279/TensorFlow-for-absolute-beginners/).

# Environment

The original tutorial/session was meant to run on Cloud Datalab, but there were several issues regarding access and clarity. As the main advantage was meant to be direct access to the datasets, but they are quite easy to include here, the environment will be the traditional Conda/Virtualenv setup.

# Notes

While most of the notebooks are purely toys or demonstrative, `2` and `4` relate to actual dataset. In particular `4` has to do with the well known MNIST classification exercise.

Due to this, the only focus will be on section `2` regarding a dataset from Manhattan, obtained from [https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).
