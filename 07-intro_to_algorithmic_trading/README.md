This session was based on [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com) lectures, specifically:

* [Beta Hedging](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/beta-hedging)
* [Pairs trading](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/introduction-to-pairs-trading)

Using the Quantopian platform, the algorithm would end up being something like [this](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/example-basic-pairs-trading-algorithm).
