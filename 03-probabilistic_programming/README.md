In this session by [@twiecki](https://twitter.com/twiecki) [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) was referenced quite a lot.

Emphasis was put on the analysis of time series with non-stationary regimes (typical of financial markets).

Models such as GARCH and the [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) were referenced on the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wHKJIEbrooK2cv41F01n5OeFnbFkFrCz7c5QRCkPCgQ/edit#slide=id.g27ae21601b_0_211).

But using PyMC3 the random walk was used for modeling, as in [http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2017/03/14/random-walk-deep-net/](http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2017/03/14/random-walk-deep-net/).
