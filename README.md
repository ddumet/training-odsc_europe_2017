# ODSC Europe 2017

## Description

This is a bundle compiling information (and snapshots of extenal repositories) related to the ODSC Europe sessions of 2017, held October 12-14 in London).

## Sessions

The intention is creating a folder per session attended, including slides and links when available.


* Algorithmic Trading, by Yves Hilpisch:
	- Code from [https://gist.github.com/yhilpisch/35a18382cfdd850c55fe971ae54cf752](https://gist.github.com/yhilpisch/35a18382cfdd850c55fe971ae54cf752) or [https://goo.gl/LAQ8Ze](https://goo.gl/LAQ8Ze)

* Deep Learning with TensorFlow for absolute beginners, by Kaz Sato and Matthias Feys:
	- Presentation at [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OzUurRlaHHr_z9eiRFzlPWrr64Jtx1kthrhyuK1Bm8s/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OzUurRlaHHr_z9eiRFzlPWrr64Jtx1kthrhyuK1Bm8s/edit?usp=sharing)
	- This workshop was way too basic and we spent most of the time setting up Google Codelabs accounts and instances. I ended up downloading the dataset from [https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), instead of using directly from the cloud managed BigQuery dataset. It was easy downloading it locally (it takes 240 MB or 40 MB compressed).

* Probabilistic programming, by Tomas Wiecki:
   - This was one of a series of sessions in quantitative trading (or Quant Finance), mostly centered around [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) for the sessions.
   - The most interesting point (other than the idea of making money :) ), was Bayesian statistics applications.

* Insights from Complex Network Data, by Pablo Suau.
* Deep Learning for Developers, by Julien Simon.
* Deep Learning in Keras, by Leonard de Marchi.
* Introduction to Algorithmic Trading, by Max Margenot.
* Introduction to Bayesian Analysis in Python, by Peadar Coyle.
* Open Containeriation Tooling, by Phil Weir.
* Training, Managing and Deploying Models, by Piotr Migda≈Ç: essentially how to use [Neptune](https://deepsense.ai/).
* Bayesian A/B testing, by Marc Garcia.
* TDD-ing a Bayesian Classifier, by Robert Hardy: a look at [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

## Environment

I'm currently using my own environment based on conda [https://github.com/tnarik/env-machine_learning](https://github.com/tnarik/env-machine_learning).

## Moving forward

Apart from pointers and links to libraries, techonologies and concepts (is always good to have an overview of what's out there), I started thinking on a couple of ideas and toy projects (either for practice or to further explore some new territories). Those won't be available here as they deserve their own repositories.
